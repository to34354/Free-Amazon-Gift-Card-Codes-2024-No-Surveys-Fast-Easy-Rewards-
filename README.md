1. Sign-Up Bonuses from Trusted Platforms

There are several reputable platforms that reward users with Amazon gift cards for completing simple tasks, such as signing up for services, downloading apps, or making purchases. These platforms work with well-known brands to offer gift cards in exchange for your participation in their programs.

Some of the best platforms to consider include:

    Swagbucks: One of the most popular and trusted rewards platforms, Swagbucks allows you to earn points (called SB) that can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards. You can earn SB by doing things like shopping online, watching videos, taking short surveys, or even searching the web. Once you've accumulated enough points, you can redeem them for gift cards directly through their website or app.

    InboxDollars: Similar to Swagbucks, InboxDollars offers users cash rewards for completing simple tasks, such as reading emails, taking surveys, and playing games. Your earnings can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards after reaching a minimum balance.

    MyPoints: This platform offers rewards for activities like shopping, reading emails, and completing surveys. For each activity you complete, you earn points, which can then be exchanged for Amazon gift cards.

All these platforms have a straightforward sign-up process, and there‚Äôs no need to worry about excessive spam or long surveys. Simply sign up, complete the tasks you‚Äôre interested in, and start earning Amazon gift card codes.
2. Referral Programs: Share & Earn

Many popular apps and services offer referral programs that allow you to earn free Amazon gift cards simply by inviting friends and family to join the platform. These programs typically reward you with points or credits once the person you referred completes a specific action, such as signing up or making a purchase.

Some notable referral programs include:

    Rakuten (formerly Ebates): Rakuten rewards users with cashback for shopping at hundreds of online retailers. By referring friends to sign up, you earn additional cashback, which can be converted into Amazon gift cards.

    Acorns: Acorns is an investment app that rounds up your everyday purchases and invests the spare change. For each friend you refer to Acorns, you earn bonuses that can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards.

By leveraging referral programs, you can boost your gift card balance by simply sharing links with others. The more people you refer, the more gift cards you can earn!
3. Use Cashback and Rewards Apps

In 2024, cashback apps are more popular than ever, and they can be a goldmine when it comes to earning Amazon gift cards. These apps offer users cashback or rewards points when they make purchases at participating stores. The best part? You can convert your cashback into Amazon gift cards, often with no minimum redemption threshold!

Some of the most popular cashback apps include:

    Ibotta: Ibotta allows you to earn cashback on purchases at hundreds of stores, including grocery stores, retail shops, and online marketplaces like Amazon. Once you‚Äôve earned enough cashback, you can convert your earnings into gift cards, including Amazon gift cards.

    Dosh: Dosh is another great cashback app that offers users the chance to earn money by shopping at partner merchants or making purchases online. Your earnings can be redeemed via PayPal or gift cards, including Amazon.

    Shopkick: Shopkick is a unique rewards app that rewards users for walking into stores, scanning items, and making purchases. You can redeem your points for a wide variety of gift cards, including Amazon.

These apps make earning gift cards incredibly easy, and since many offer cashback on purchases you were going to make anyway, it‚Äôs essentially free money that can be used to shop on Amazon.
4. Enter Contests and Giveaways

If you‚Äôre feeling lucky, entering contests and giveaways is another way to earn free Amazon gift cards. Many social media platforms, websites, and influencers regularly host giveaways where they offer Amazon gift cards as prizes. These giveaways typically involve simple entry requirements such as liking a post, following a page, or tagging friends in the comments.

    Subscribe to newsletters from websites that specialize in couponing and giveaways.
    Check out sites like Giveaway Frenzy or Contest Girl, which list various online contests offering Amazon gift cards.

Although winning a giveaway can take some luck, it‚Äôs one of the easiest and most exciting ways to score a free Amazon gift card.
5. Amazon‚Äôs Own Rewards Programs

Did you know that Amazon has its own rewards programs that allow you to earn gift cards? For example, Amazon Prime members can earn rewards points for making purchases through Amazon‚Äôs platform. These points can be converted into gift cards or used for discounts on future purchases.

Additionally, if you‚Äôre an Amazon shopper who frequently makes purchases, consider signing up for the Amazon Credit Card.
